# Tiny-language-Parser
 implementation of the TINY parser using recursive descent method.
 
**Inputs :**
- List of ( tokenvalue, tokentype)   Example:   x ,IDENTIFIER  :=, ASSIGN  4,NUMBER 
- The input list should follow the same syntax as mentioned in the previous example  tokenvalue , tokentype (Spaces are allowed between them) 
- Input list can be input through GUI textbox or by loading a text file 

**Output:** 
1. State whether the statements are accepted by TINY language or not 
2. Draw Syntax tree on a GUI based application 
3. IF you do not support GUI ( and will lose GUI marks) you can output recognized structures by the TINY language parser into a file or on the console screen ( like drawing the syntax tree by describing it using statement names)
